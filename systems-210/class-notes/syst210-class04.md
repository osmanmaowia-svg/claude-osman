## ENGINEERING HUMOR TO START YOUR DAY!

A software engineer, a hardware engineer and a department manager were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They were driving down a steep mountain road when suddenly the brakes on their car failed. The car careened almost out of control down the road, bouncing off the crash barriers, until it miraculously ground to a halt scraping along the mountainside.

The car's occupants, shaken but unhurt, now had a problem: they were stuck halfway down a mountain in a car with no brakes. What were they to do?

"I know," said the department manager, "Let's have a meeting, propose a Vision, formulate a Mission Statement, define some Goals and by a process of Continuous Improvement find a solution to the Critical Problems, and we can be on our way."

"No, no," said the hardware engineer, "That will take far too long, and besides, that method has never worked before. I've got my Swiss Army knife with me, and in no time at all I can strip down the car's braking system, isolate the fault, fix it and we can be on our way."

"Well," said the software engineer, "Before we do anything, I think we should push the car back up the road and see if it happens again."

---

# UNDERSTANDING TEAMS

---

## TEAMWORK: THE FORCE MULTIPLIER

### The ineffective team:
Multiple arrows pointing in different directions = Small resultant arrow (minimal progress)

### The effective team:
Multiple arrows aligned in the same direction = Large resultant arrow (significant progress)

---

## STAGES IN TEAM FORMATION

- **Forming**
- **Storming**
- **Norming**
- **Performing**

**Goal: get to "performing" as quickly and painlessly as possible**

---

## ESTABLISHING YOUR TEAM

### Get to know each other
- Learn everyone's name
- Learn everyone's skills, likes, dislikes
- Make a skills matrix
- Agree on ground rules for team interactions and how conflicts will be resolved

### Create a team vision
- Short paragraph, describes goals and what your team will accomplish and ground rules for team interaction

### Choose a leader and a project manager (not necessarily the same person)

### Create a project plan
- Tasks to be accomplished
- Timeline
- Responsible person for each task

### Set up electronic work area
- Post project timeline and keep it updated
- Post files you are working on

---

## MEETING MANAGEMENT

- Choose scribe, meeting manager, timekeeper
- Agree on desired results
  - Review action items from last meeting
  - Review project schedule -- are we on track?
- Agree on process for achieving desired results and time allotted to each step
- Stay on topic, one topic at a time
- Timekeeper and meeting manager are responsible for keeping team on track
- When unrelated but important points come up, put them in a "bin" to come back to later
  - Scribe writes them down in "future reference" section of minutes
  - Use time consciously. Extend if necessary to achieve desired results
  - Don't railroad. Don't cave into strong personalities. Be assertive without being aggressive. Play win-win.
- Keep visible record of achievements and to-do items
- At end of meeting:
  - Evaluate. What went well? Not so well? How can we improve next time?
  - Develop action items

---

## MEETING MINUTES

### Minutes should have 4 sections:
- Date, time, list of attendees
- Agenda
- Meeting content
- Action items

### The first agenda item should be to review action items from the last meeting
- Check off completed action items
- Record unfinished action items as action items for this meeting

### Meeting content section should have a sub-section for each item on the agenda that is covered at the meeting

### When an action item is identified, add it to the list of action items!
- If someone says "we need to do X," the meeting manager should assign a person to do X or to make sure X is done
- Watch out for unassigned action items -- they will not get done!

### Go over action items at end of meeting
- Each action item has a responsible person or persons
- Make sure everyone knows what they are responsible for doing
- Make sure there are no unassigned action items

---

## MANAGE SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES

### Make a schedule
- Milestones (what has to be done)
- Due dates
- Responsible person

### Agree ahead of time on consequences for missing deadlines or producing sloppy work

### Monitor progress constantly
- Assign someone to track schedule
- Review schedule at every meeting
  - Where are we?
  - What is on track and what is off track?
  - Do we need to revise our schedule?
- Send friendly reminders of due dates

### Apply constructive problem solving to deal with slippage

### Remember that last-minute crunches are harder for groups to manage than for individuals!

---

## TEAM ROLES

Team members play different roles. Roles can be fixed for the semester, or you can rotate duties.

### Examples of roles:

**Leader**
- Organizes overall effort, keeps team energized and focused on group vision

**Coordinator**
- Sets up meetings, keeps meetings focused, makes sure team is on track

**External interface**
- Talks to professor and other outside stakeholders

**Manager**
- Keeps track of due dates and schedules, organizes who does what, makes sure group is on track to meet deadlines

**Recorder**
- Keeps a record of team activities

---

## COMMON COMPLAINTS

- "We go around in circles and don't get anywhere!"

- "I'm doing all the work and those other people aren't doing their share!"

- "No one tells me…
  - When the group is meeting."
  - What I should do."

- "That person always wants to do things her own way and won't listen to me."

- "I worked really hard on this and it never made it into the final report."

---

## WHAT TO DO!

### There are no easy answers

### Blaming others: easy but wrong
- Everyone shares responsibility for making your team work effectively
- Blame interferes with constructive solution

### The only thing you can control is how you behave
- Be part of the solution not part of the problem
- Try to look for win-win solutions
- Take initiative
- Consider this a learning experience

### This will not be the last time you encounter team difficulties!

# INITIATING SYSTEM DESIGN

---

## STATEMENT OF NEED → KICKS OFF THE SYSTEM LIFE-CYCLE

### Describe the problem context on why a system is needed

### Describe why a new or updated system is needed

### Develop a business case for the system
- Why not accept the current solution
- What are the alternatives
- Why customer will buy a system
- Expected sales and breakeven

### **Describe a need and not a solution**

*Buede & Miller, The Engineering Design of Systems, Figure 1.1*

---

## EXAMPLE STATEMENT OF NEED / MISSION STATEMENT

*Market research indicates that approximately 30,000 buildings of between 10 and 20 stories are constructed each year. Studies show that between 100 and 150 people occupy each floor of a typical building in the target building class. There is a need for rapid, safe, reliable, and cost-effective vertical transportation to move people between floors.*

*- Buede & Miller, The Engineering Design of Systems*

---

## BUILDING NEED STATEMENT FOR A SYSTEM (CONFERENCE MANAGEMENT EXAMPLE)

### Set the stage
Company XXX manages 25-30 conferences per year. Conference management includes tracking the following: Budget ($200K to $5M per conf.), Registration (150 to 2000 people per conf.), Submissions (~ 1000 per conf.), Logistics (food, lodging), interactions with vendors

### Describe existing solution
Company XXX has a system that provides partial tracking for some of the required aspects of conference management. However, this system does not provide a central repository of conference information that is accessible to all planners responsible for a given conference.

### State what is needed
There is a need for all persons responsible for planning a given conference to access relevant information about the conference and to view information provided by others that has impact on their area of responsibility.

### Business case
The cost of the new system would be offset within three years by savings due to increased efficiency in planning.

## A SYSTEM ALWAYS HAS STAKEHOLDERS!!!

**Stakeholder:** anyone or any organization having a vested interest in a system, its outcomes and success of the system, its mission, products, services or activities.

### Systems engineers job is to identify the stakeholder and make sure their needs are addressed

- Who will be affected?
- How are they affected?
  - Who wants a change?
- Is there major tension between different groups of stakeholders
- Who has the power to influence?

---

## IDENTIFYING GROUPS OF STAKEHOLDERS

### Who are the stakeholders for a credit card payment processing system?

### Who are the stakeholders for Hubble Telescope?

### Who are the stakeholders for SYST 210?

---

## IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDER NEED STATEMENTS

- Ensure that system is focused on **customer/user needs**
- Identify **latent or hidden** needs as well as **explicit** needs
- Provide a fact base for **justifying the system specifications**
- Create an **archival record** of the needs activity of the development process
- Ensure that no critical customer need is **missed or forgotten**
- Develop a **common understanding** of customer needs among members of the development team

**The people who control the details of the system must interact with stakeholders and experience the use environment of the system.**

## GUIDELINES FOR WRITING NEEDS STATEMENTS

| Guideline | Customer Statement | Need Statement-Wrong | Need Statement-Right |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| What Not How | "Why don't you put protective shields around the battery contacts?" | The screwdriver battery contacts are covered by a plastic sliding door. | The screwdriver battery is protected from accidental shorting. |

---

## GUIDELINES FOR WRITING NEEDS STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

| Guideline | Customer Statement | Need Statement-Wrong | Need Statement-Right |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| What Not How | "Why don't you put protective shields around the battery contacts?" | The screwdriver battery contacts are covered by a plastic sliding door. | The screwdriver battery is protected from accidental shorting. |
| Specificity | "I drop my screwdriver all the time." | The screwdriver is rugged. | The screwdriver operates normally after repeated dropping. |
| Attribute of the system | "I'd like to charge my battery from my cigarette lighter." | An automobile cigarette lighter adapter can charge the screwdriver battery. | The screwdriver battery can be charged from an automobile cigarette lighter. |
| Avoid "Must" and "Should" | "I hate it when I don't know how much juice is left in the batteries of my cordless tools." | The screwdriver should provide an indication of the energy level of the battery. | The screwdriver provides an indication of the energy level of the battery. |

## STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM DESIGN PROCESS

**System Statement of Need** and **Stakeholder Analysis** feed into:

→ **Define System-level Design Problem**

Which branches into two parallel paths:

**Left path:**
→ **Develop Logical/Functional Architecture**

**Right path:**
→ **Develop Physical Architecture**

Both paths converge at:
→ **Develop Allocated Architecture**

Which then branches to:
→ **Develop Interface Architecture** → **Develop Qualification System**
