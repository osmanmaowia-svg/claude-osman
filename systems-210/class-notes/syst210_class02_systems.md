## DEFINITION OF A SYSTEM

- "An assemblage or combination of things or parts forming a complex or unitary whole" (Kast and Rosenzweig, 1970)

- "A set of interrelated components working together toward some common objective" (Blanchard and Fabrycky, 2011)

- "A system is an arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit behavior or meaning that the individual constituents do not." (INCOSE Fellows, 2019)

- "...a collection of hardware, software, people, facilities, and procedures, organized to accomplish some common objectives". [Buede]

### "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." (Aristotle)
*is the system*

---

## DEFINITION OF A SYSTEM (CONTD.)

### Commonalities among definitions:

**Contains multiple components (parts, sub-systems, etc.)**

**Components are connected to one another**

**Components together achieve a common objective unachievable by individual parts**

### A system can be:
- Simple or complex
- A process, product, service or combination of any two or all
- Natural, social, socio-technical, or technical (engineered)

---

## WHAT IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM?

- A system with large number of parts
- A system with large number of different parts
- A system with large number of different parts connected in different ways
- A system with large number of different parts connected in different ways where the state of the parts and connections change over time
- A system with large number of different parts connected in different ways where the state of the parts and connections change over time and the people using the systems have different cognitive abilities

## ENGINEERED VS. NATURAL SYSTEMS

### Engineered Systems

An **engineered system** is a **system** designed or adapted to interact with an **anticipated operational environment** to achieve one or more intended **purposes** while complying with applicable constraints.

*[Image of commercial aircraft with labeled systems]*

### Natural Systems

A natural system is an **open system** whose elements, boundary, and relationships exist **independently of human control**.

## LET'S DO A SMALL EXERCISE ON SYSTEM ATTRIBUTES AND LEARN ABOUT OIL PLATFORMS

- "An **oil platform, oil rig, offshore platform**, or oil and/or gas production platform is a large structure with facilities to extract, and process petroleum and natural gas that lie in rock formations beneath the seabed. Many oil platforms will also contain facilities to accommodate their workforce, although it is also common for there to be a separate accommodation platform bridge linked to the production platform." (Wikipedia)

- "A **drilling rig** is an integrated system that drills wells, such as oil or water wells, in the earth's subsurface. Drilling rigs can be massive structures housing equipment used to drill water wells, oil wells, or natural gas extraction wells, or they can be small enough to be moved manually by one person and such are called augers. Drilling rigs can sample subsurface mineral deposits, test rock, soil and groundwater physical properties, and also can be used to install sub-surface fabrications, such as underground utilities, instrumentation, tunnels or wells." (Wikipedia)

## IN-CLASS EXERCISE (~10-12 MINS)

Assemble in 4 teams and answer the following questions:

- **Team 1:** What is the purpose and function of an offshore oil platform?

- **Team 2:** What is the structure and hierarchy of an offshore oil platform?

- **Team 3:** What is the operational environment and system boundary of an offshore oil platform?

- **Team 4:** What are some of the internal and external interfaces of an offshore oil platform?

You can refer to online sources to get a better understanding of offshore oil platforms and oil rigs!
