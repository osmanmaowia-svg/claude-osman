## LET'S GET TO KNOW SYST 210: SYSTEM DESIGN

### What is a System?

Systems are composed of multiple different elements that interact with one another to provide a capability not achievable by elements alone

*(more formal definitions to come later)*

### What is Design?

Design is the **art** of problem solving. Design is a mental exercise of creating purposeful solutions. Design is part engineering and part art.

*(more formal definitions to come later)*

**SYST 210 is about Design of Systems**

---

## WHY IS 'SYSTEM DESIGN' NEEDED?

Let's learn from TikTok!!!

*(Reference to TikTok video about pilot remembering buttons)*

---

## WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN SYST 210

After completing the course, students will be able to:

- Describe **mission statement** of a system and derive **stakeholder need statements**
- Create an **operational concept** and **objectives hierarchy** for a system and use these, along with stakeholder inputs, to develop **requirements** for the system
- Draw **system boundary** and identify external systems and interfaces
- Create and critique a **system model**
- Build a **hierarchical decomposition** of the transformation of **inputs into outputs**
- Define **functional, physical and allocated architectures** for a system
- Represent a system model with **model-based systems engineering** software tools
- Apply methods from **decision analysis** to select among options for system design, including the analysis of buy/build decisions
- Contribute to **group problem solving**
- Communicate a system design through **oral presentation and technical documents**

## EXTRA CREDITS (UP TO 3%; 0.5% PER ACTIVITY)

- You can earn extra credit for attending a professional event that is relevant to your studies
- I will be making periodic announcements of INCOSE Washington Metro Area meetings and other events that can be counted for extra credit. At the end of the semester, you can get extra credit for attending senior design presentations
- You may also ask me about credit for other events, such as professional society meetings, lectures on engineering topics, or student chapter meetings of engineering societies. There should be an educational benefit for attending

## REQUIREMENTS AND GRADES

### What are Requirements For?

**The way it should be:**
- A communication tool between designers and stakeholders
- Team focus is on creating quality and cost-effective system
- Requirements are means to that end

**When requirements are well-specified:**
- Designer and Developers know:
  - What they need to achieve
  - Why it is important
  - How they will be evaluated
- Stakeholder know what will get
- Everyone feels process is fair

**What happens when checking the box becomes the objectives?**

### What are Grades For?

**The way it should be:**
- A communication tool between teachers and students
- Both students and teacher are a team with a common focus on learning
- Grades are means to that end

**When course requirements are well-specified:**
- Students know:
  - What they need to learn
  - Why it is important
  - How they will be evaluated
- Teachers know what students understand and what needs extra attention
- Everyone feels process is fair

**What happens when grades become the objective?**

*Adapted from Dr. Kathy Laskey*

## HONOR CODE

Mason has an Honor Code with clear guidelines regarding academic integrity. Mason's honor code is:

*"To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University Community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the university community, have set for this Honor Code: Student Members of the George Mason University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work."*

The principle of academic integrity is taken very seriously, and violations are treated gravely. Refer to the full university policy and honor code at: https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/

## ON THE USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN THIS COURSE

Students are encouraged to explore innovative tools and technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), to enhance their learning experience. However, the use of AI in assignments must adhere to the following guidelines:

### Originality and Academic Integrity
All work submitted must be the student's own. AI tools may be used to assist in research and drafting, but the final submission should reflect the student's understanding and original thought. Plagiarism, including the uncredited use of AI-generated content, is strictly prohibited.

### Transparency
If AI tools are utilized in the preparation of assignments, students must disclose the nature and extent of their use. This includes specifying which tools were used and how they contributed to the final work.

### Critical Evaluation
Students should critically evaluate any AI-generated content for accuracy and relevance. AI should be used as a supplementary resource, not a replacement for critical thinking and analysis.

### Compliance with Course Policies
The use of AI tools must comply with specific course policies and guidelines. Students should consult with the instructor if they are uncertain about the appropriateness of using AI for a particular assignment.

**Additional information:** Please see recommendations on our Generative AI Support page.

**Mason Provided AI tools for Student Use:** https://patriotai.gmu.edu/
