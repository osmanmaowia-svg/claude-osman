## 3. Network Protocols

### 3.1 Protocol Definition and Importance

**Network protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission and receipt.**

Think of protocols as the "rules of communication" that ensure different devices can understand each other, regardless of their manufacturer or operating system.

### 3.2 Human vs. Network Protocols

#### Human Protocol Examples
- **Meeting etiquette**: "Hello," introductions, turn-taking in conversation
- **Phone conversations**: "Hello?" → "Hi, it's [name]" → conversation → "Goodbye"
- **Classroom interactions**: Raising hands, waiting to be called upon

#### Network Protocol Characteristics
- **Participants**: Computers and network devices (not humans)
- **Precision**: Exact message formats and timing requirements
- **Error handling**: Built-in mechanisms for dealing with transmission problems
- **Universality**: All Internet communication governed by protocols

### 3.3 Protocol Example: Web Request Process

Let's trace a typical web request to understand protocol interactions:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Web Browser
    participant Server as Web Server
    
    Client->>Server: 1. TCP Connection Request
    Server->>Client: 2. TCP Connection Response
    Client->>Server: 3. HTTP GET Request
    Server->>Client: 4. HTTP Response (HTML file)
    Client->>Server: 5. TCP Connection Close
```

**Step-by-step Protocol Interaction:**

1. **TCP Connection Establishment**: Client initiates reliable connection
2. **Connection Acknowledgment**: Server confirms connection establishment
3. **HTTP Request**: Client sends specific request for web page
4. **Content Delivery**: Server responds with requested file
5. **Connection Termination**: Clean closure of communication session

This example shows how multiple protocols (TCP for reliable transport, HTTP for web communication) work together to accomplish a single task.

## 6. Network Core: Packet and Circuit Switching

The network core consists of interconnected routers forming a mesh topology that forwards data between end systems.

### 6.1 Core Network Functions

#### 6.1.1 Forwarding (Switching)

**Definition**: Local action of moving arriving packets from input link to appropriate output link

**Process**:
1. Examine packet header
2. Consult forwarding table
3. Determine output link
4. Forward packet

**Forwarding Table**: Maps destination addresses (or prefixes) to output links

#### 6.1.2 Routing

**Definition**: Global action of determining source-to-destination paths

**Process**:
1. Run routing algorithms
2. Build and maintain forwarding tables
3. Adapt to network changes
4. Share routing information with other routers

**Routing vs. Forwarding**: Routing is like planning a trip route; forwarding is like following road signs at each intersection.

### 6.2 Packet Switching

#### 6.2.1 Store-and-Forward Transmission

**Core Principle**: Router must receive entire packet before transmitting it on outbound link

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Host A] -->|L bits, R bps| R1[Router]
    R1 -->|L bits, R bps| B[Host B]
    
    style R1 fill:#e1f5fe
```

**Timing Analysis**:
- **Time to transmit packet**: L/R seconds
- **Store-and-forward delay**: Must wait for complete packet
- **Total delay for one hop**: 2L/R seconds

**Mathematical Example**:
- **Packet size (L)**: 10,000 bits
- **Link rate (R)**: 100 Mbps = 100 × 10⁶ bps
- **One-hop transmission delay**: 10,000 / (100 × 10⁶) = 0.1 milliseconds
- **Store-and-forward delay**: 0.1 ms (wait for complete packet)

#### 6.2.2 Queuing and Packet Loss

**Queuing Necessity**
- Occurs when arrival rate temporarily exceeds output capacity
- Packets wait in router buffers
- Multiple inputs may send to same output simultaneously

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input 1] --> Q[Router Queue]
    B[Input 2] --> Q
    C[Input 3] --> Q
    Q --> D[Output Link]
    
    subgraph Queue
        E[Packet being transmitted]
        F[Packets waiting]
        G[Available buffer space]
    end
```

**Packet Loss Mechanism**
- **Finite buffers**: Queues have limited capacity
- **Buffer overflow**: Arriving packets dropped when queue full
- **Performance impact**: Lost packets require retransmission
- **Applications**: Must handle lost packets appropriately

### 6.3 Circuit Switching

#### 6.3.2 Multiplexing in Circuit Switching

**Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**
- **Technique**: Divide frequency spectrum into bands
- **Allocation**: Each call gets dedicated frequency band
- **Capacity**: Limited by available spectrum
- **Example**: Traditional telephone systems

**Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**  
- **Technique**: Divide time into recurring slots
- **Allocation**: Each call gets dedicated time slots
- **Rotation**: Slots cycle among active calls

- C-D link: 15 circuits
- D-A link: 16 circuits

**Capacity Analysis**:
- **Bottleneck**: C-D link with 15 circuits
- **Maximum simultaneous calls**: 15
- **Resource allocation**: End-to-end reservation required

### 6.4 Packet vs. Circuit Switching Comparison

#### 6.4.1 Quantitative Example

**Network Scenario**:
- **Link capacity**: 1 Gbps
- **User requirements**: 100 Mbps when active
- **Activity pattern**: 10% active time

**Circuit Switching Capacity**:
- **Maximum users**: 1000 Mbps ÷ 100 Mbps = 10 users
- **Resource utilization**: Often low due to idle periods

**Packet Switching Capacity**:

## 8. Performance Analysis: Delay, Loss, and Throughput

Understanding network performance is crucial for designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting computer networks.

### 8.1 Packet Delay Components

Every packet experiences delay as it travels through the network. **Total nodal delay** consists of four components:

```
Total Delay = Processing Delay + Queuing Delay + Transmission Delay + Propagation Delay
dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop
```

#### 8.1.1 Processing Delay (dproc)

**Activities Performed**:
- Examine packet header fields
- Determine output link using forwarding table
- Check for bit errors (checksums)
- Update header fields (TTL decrement)

**Characteristics**:
- **Magnitude**: Microseconds or less in modern routers
- **Variability**: Relatively constant and predictable
- **Factors**: Router processing power, forwarding table size

#### 8.1.2 Queuing Delay (dqueue)

**Cause**: Waiting in output buffer for transmission

**Characteristics**:
- **Variability**: Most variable component of delay
- **Range**: Zero (no queue) to seconds (heavy congestion)
- **Dependency**: Network congestion level

**Traffic Intensity Analysis**:
```
Traffic Intensity = La/R
where:
- L = packet length (bits)
- a = average packet arrival rate (packets/sec)
- R = link bandwidth (bits/sec)
```

**Queuing Behavior**:
- **La/R ≈ 0**: Minimal queuing delay
- **La/R → 1**: Rapidly increasing delay
- **La/R > 1**: Unstable system, infinite average delay

#### 8.1.3 Transmission Delay (dtrans)

**Definition**: Time to push all packet bits onto the link

**Formula**:
```
dtrans = L/R
where:
- L = packet length (bits)
- R = link transmission rate (bits/sec)
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Dependency**: Function of packet size and link speed only
- **Independence**: Not related to distance between nodes
- **Alternative names**: Store-and-forward delay, serialization delay

**Example Calculation**:
- **Packet size**: 1000 bytes = 8000 bits
- **Link rate**: 10 Mbps = 10 × 10⁶ bps
- **Transmission delay**: 8000 / (10 × 10⁶) = 0.8 milliseconds

#### 8.1.4 Propagation Delay (dprop)

**Definition**: Time for signal to travel from source to destination

**Formula**:
```
dprop = d/s
where:
- d = length of physical link (meters)
- s = propagation speed (~2 × 10⁸ m/s in copper/fiber)
```

**Propagation Speeds**:
- **Vacuum (speed of light)**: 3 × 10⁸ m/s
- **Fiber optic cable**: ~2 × 10⁸ m/s
- **Copper wire**: ~2.3 × 10⁸ m/s

**Example Calculation**:
- **Distance**: 3000 km = 3 × 10⁶ meters
- **Speed**: 2 × 10⁸ m/s
- **Propagation delay**: (3 × 10⁶) / (2 × 10⁸) = 15 milliseconds

### 8.2 Queuing Delay Analysis

#### 8.2.1 Traffic Intensity Impact

**Mathematical Model**:
- **Arrival rate**: a packets/second
- **Service rate**: R/L packets/second
- **Utilization**: ρ = La/R

**Queue Behavior Regions**:

1. **Light Traffic (La/R ≈ 0)**:
   - Average queuing delay ≈ 0
   - Packets rarely wait

2. **Moderate Traffic (La/R ≈ 0.5)**:
   - Average queuing delay = (La/R) / (2(1 - La/R))
   - Noticeable but manageable delays

3. **Heavy Traffic (La/R → 1)**:
   - Average queuing delay → ∞
   - System becomes unstable

4. **Overload (La/R > 1)**:
   - Queue grows without bound
   - Packet loss inevitable

#### 8.2.2 Queuing Models

**M/M/1 Queue (Poisson Arrivals, Exponential Service)**:
```
Average Queuing Delay = ρ / (1 - ρ) × (L/R)
where ρ = La/R
```

This model assumes:
- Poisson arrival process
- Exponential service times
- Single server (output link)
- Infinite buffer capacity

### 8.3 Packet Loss

#### 8.3.1 Loss Mechanisms

**Buffer Overflow**:
- **Finite buffers**: Real routers have limited memory
- **Congestion**: Arrival rate exceeds departure rate
- **Drop policies**: Tail drop, random early detection

**Loss Consequences**:
- **Retransmission**: End systems may retransmit lost packets
- **Application impact**: Depends on application requirements
- **Performance degradation**: Reduced effective throughput

#### 8.3.2 Loss Probability

**Buffer Occupancy Model**:
- **Traffic intensity**: Higher La/R increases loss probability
- **Buffer size**: Larger buffers reduce loss probability
- **Burst characteristics**: Traffic burstiness affects loss

### 8.4 End-to-End Delay Analysis

#### 8.4.1 Caravan Analogy

**Highway Scenario**:
- **Cars**: Bits in a packet
- **Caravan**: Complete packet
- **Toll booth**: Router with store-and-forward processing
- **Highway**: Communication link

**Timing Analysis**:
1. **Caravan formation**: Time to create packet
2. **Toll booth service**: Transmission delay (L/R)
3. **Highway travel**: Propagation delay (d/s)
4. **Multiple toll booths**: Multiple router hops

**Example Calculation**:
- **10 cars**: 10-bit packet
- **Service time**: 12 seconds per car
- **Highway distance**: 100 km at 100 km/hr

**Results**:
- **Service time**: 10 × 12 = 120 seconds
- **Travel time**: 100 km ÷ 100 km/hr = 3600 seconds
- **Total time**: 120 + 3600 = 3720 seconds

#### 8.4.2 Store-and-Forward vs. Cut-Through

**Store-and-Forward**:
- **Requirement**: Complete packet received before forwarding
- **Advantage**: Error checking possible
- **Delay**: Full transmission delay at each hop

**Cut-Through (Theoretical)**:
- **Concept**: Forward bits as soon as received
- **Advantage**: Reduced delay for long packets
- **Reality**: Not used due to error checking requirements

### 8.5 Throughput Analysis

#### 8.5.1 Throughput Definition

**Instantaneous Throughput**: Rate of data transfer at specific moment
**Average Throughput**: Rate of data transfer over extended period

**Units**: Typically measured in bits/second (bps)

#### 8.5.2 Bottleneck Link Analysis

```mermaid
graph LR
    S[Server] -->|Rs bps| N[Network Core] -->|Rc bps| C[Client]
    
    style N fill:#e1f5fe
```

**End-to-End Throughput**: Limited by slowest link (bottleneck)

**Formula**:
```
Throughput = min{Rs, R1, R2, ..., RN, Rc}
```

**Common Scenarios**:
- **Server-limited**: Rs < Rc (server upload speed limits)
- **Client-limited**: Rc < Rs (client download speed limits)
- **Network-limited**: Internal link capacity limits

#### 8.5.3 Shared Bottleneck Analysis

**Multiple Connection Scenario**:
- **N connections**: Sharing bottleneck link of capacity R
- **Per-connection throughput**: R/N (assuming fair sharing)
- **Individual link rates**: Rs, Rc for each connection

**Effective Throughput**:
```
Per-connection throughput = min{Rs, Rc, R/N}
```

**Example**:
- **Shared link**: 100 Mbps
- **10 connections**: Each gets 10 Mbps maximum
- **Individual rates**: 50 Mbps server, 20 Mbps client
- **Result**: 10 Mbps per connection (shared link is bottleneck)

### 8.6 Traceroute: Measuring Real Network Performance

#### 8.6.1 Traceroute Operation

**Principle**: Send packets with increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) values

**Process**:
1. **TTL = 1**: Packet expires at first router, returns ICMP error
2. **TTL = 2**: Packet expires at second router, returns ICMP error
3. **Continue**: Until reaching destination

**Measurements**:
- **Round-trip time**: Time from send to receive response
- **Router identification**: IP address of each hop
- **Path discovery**: Complete route to destination

#### 8.6.2 Traceroute Output Analysis

**Example Output**:
```
1 cs-gw (128.119.240.254) 1 ms 1 ms 2 ms
2 border1-rt (128.119.3.145) 1 ms 1 ms 2 ms
3 gw1.domain.net (192.168.1.1) 104 ms 109 ms 106 ms
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Hop number**: Sequential router in path
- **Router name/IP**: Identity of router
- **Three measurements**: Multiple probes for accuracy
- **Time values**: Round-trip delay to each router

**Key Observations**:
- **Delay variations**: Show network variability
- **Geographic changes**: Sudden delay increases indicate long-distance links
- **Missing responses**: "*" indicates packet loss or no response

## 9. Network Security Fundamentals

### 9.1 Security in Network Design

#### 9.1.1 Original Internet Philosophy

**Historical Context**: The Internet was not originally designed with security as a primary concern.

**Original Assumptions**:
- **Trusted users**: "Mutually trusting users attached to transparent network"
- **Academic environment**: Cooperation rather than competition
- **Small scale**: Limited number of known participants
- **Research focus**: Functionality over security

**Modern Reality**:
- **Billions of users**: Many with malicious intent
- **Critical infrastructure**: Economic and social dependence
- **Valuable data**: Financial and personal information
- **Global reach**: Crossing legal and cultural boundaries

#### 9.1.2 Security as an Afterthought

**Consequence**: Security mechanisms retrofitted to existing protocols

**Challenges**:
- **Backward compatibility**: Cannot break existing systems
- **Performance impact**: Security often adds overhead
- **Deployment complexity**: Coordinating upgrades across global infrastructure
- **Economic factors**: Security costs vs. security benefits

### 9.2 Common Network Security Threats

#### 9.2.1 Packet Interception (Sniffing)

**Attack Method**: Monitoring network traffic to capture data

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Legitimate Host A] --> S[Shared Network Segment]
    B[Legitimate Host B] --> S
    C[Malicious Host] --> S
    S --> D[Network Infrastructure]
    
    C -.->|Captures All Traffic| E[Stolen Data]
    
    style C fill:#ffcdd2
    style E fill:#ffcdd2
```

**Vulnerable Technologies**:
- **Shared Ethernet**: Hub-based networks (largely obsolete)
- **Wireless networks**: Radio transmissions inherently broadcast
- **Compromised infrastructure**: Malicious access points or switches

**Attack Techniques**:
- **Promiscuous mode**: Network interface captures all packets

graph TD
    A[Attacker] --> B[Command & Control Server]
    B --> C[Compromised Host 1]
    B --> D[Compromised Host 2]
    B --> E[Compromised Host 3]
    B --> F[Compromised Host N]
    
    C --> T[Target Server]
    D --> T
    E --> T
    F --> T
    
    style A fill:#ffcdd2
    style B fill:#ffcdd2
    style T fill:#c8e6c9
```

**Attack Process**:
1. **Recruitment**: Compromise many hosts (create botnet)

**Circuit Switching**: Dedicated end-to-end resource reservation for communication session

**Store-and-Forward**: Router receives complete packet before forwarding to next hop

**Cut-Through**: Router begins forwarding packet before complete reception (theoretical)

#### 12.2.2 Router Functions

**Forwarding**: Local action of moving packets from input to output link using forwarding table

**Routing**: Global action of determining paths using routing algorithms

**Queuing**: Buffering packets when arrival rate exceeds departure rate

**Packet Loss**: Dropping packets when buffer capacity exceeded

### 12.3 Performance Metrics and Formulas

#### 12.3.1 Delay Components

**Processing Delay (dproc)**: Time for router to examine packet and determine output link
- Typical range: Microseconds or less
- Factors: Router processing speed, forwarding table size

**Queuing Delay (dqueue)**: Time packet waits in output buffer
- Range: Zero to seconds depending on congestion
- Most variable component of delay

**Transmission Delay (dtrans)**: Time to push all packet bits onto link
```
dtrans = L/R
where: L = packet length (bits), R = link transmission rate (bits/sec)
```

**Propagation Delay (dprop)**: Time for signal to travel from source to destination
```
dprop = d/s
where: d = link distance (meters), s = propagation speed (~2×10⁸ m/s)
```

**Total Nodal Delay**:
```
dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop
```

#### 12.3.2 Queuing Analysis

**Traffic Intensity**:
```
ρ = La/R
where: L = packet length (bits), a = arrival rate (packets/sec), R = link rate (bits/sec)
```

**Queuing Behavior**:
- La/R ≈ 0: Minimal queuing delay
- La/R → 1: Rapidly increasing delay  
- La/R > 1: Unstable system, infinite average delay

**Average Queuing Delay (M/M/1 model)**:
```
Average Queuing Delay = ρ/(1-ρ) × (L/R)
```

#### 12.3.3 Throughput Analysis

**End-to-End Throughput**: Rate of successful data delivery from source to destination

**Bottleneck Link**: Link with minimum capacity limiting overall throughput

**Throughput Formula**:
```
Throughput = min{Rs, R1, R2, ..., RN, Rc}
where Rs = server rate, Rc = client rate, Ri = intermediate link rates
```

```
Per-connection throughput = min{Rs, Rc, R/N}
where R = shared link capacity, N = number of connections
```
