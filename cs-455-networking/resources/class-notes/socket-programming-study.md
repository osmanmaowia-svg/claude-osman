# 15 Authentic Socket Programming Test Questions from CS-455 Networking Courses

Based on comprehensive research across university test banks, Kurose & Ross materials, and certification resources, I've compiled 15 authentic test questions that professors commonly use. These questions cover all requested topics and include detailed explanations.

## TCP vs UDP Fundamental Differences

### Question 1: Socket Type Creation (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** Kurose & Ross Knowledge Checks, CS-455 Course Materials

**Complete Question:** 
Which Python code creates a TCP socket?
a) `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)`
b) `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
c) `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.TCP_SOCKET)`
d) `socket.socket(socket.UDP, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`

**Correct Answer:** b) `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`

**Explanation:** AF_INET specifies IPv4, and SOCK_STREAM creates a TCP socket providing reliable, connection-oriented byte-stream service.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) SOCK_DGRAM creates a UDP socket, not TCP
- c) TCP_SOCKET is not a valid Python socket constant
- d) UDP is not a valid address family parameter

**Key Concept:** Socket type constants and their protocol associations

### Question 2: UDP Socket Characteristics (Multiple Choice - Check All)
**Source:** Official Kurose & Ross Interactive Problems

**Complete Question:**
Which characteristics are associated with UDP sockets? Check all that apply:
a) The application must explicitly specify IP destination address and port for each datagram
b) Data from different clients can be received on the same socket
c) `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)` creates this type of socket
d) Provides unreliable transfer of datagrams from client to server

**Correct Answer:** All (a, b, c, d) are correct

**Explanation:** UDP is connectionless, requiring destination info per packet. Multiple clients can send to one UDP socket. SOCK_DGRAM creates UDP sockets providing unreliable datagram service.

**Key Concept:** UDP connectionless nature and implications

### Question 3: Transport Services (True/False)
**Source:** UNCW CSC344 Midterm Exam

**Complete Question:**
TCP guarantees message boundaries in data transmission.

**Correct Answer:** False

**Explanation:** TCP provides a reliable byte stream without preserving message boundaries. Applications must implement their own framing if message boundaries are needed.

**Why false:** TCP treats data as a continuous stream of bytes. If you send two 100-byte messages, the receiver might get them as one 200-byte chunk or multiple smaller chunks.

**Key Concept:** TCP stream vs UDP datagram semantics

## Socket API Methods and Sequences

### Question 4: Server Socket Methods (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** Sanfoundry Computer Networks Assessment

**Complete Question:**
Which method does a TCP server use to wait for client connections?
a) `Public Output Stream getOutputStream()`
b) `Public Socket accept()`
c) `Public void connect()`
d) `Public Socket receive()`

**Correct Answer:** b) `Public Socket accept()`

**Explanation:** The accept() method blocks until a client connects, then returns a new socket for that specific client connection.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) getOutputStream() is for sending data, not accepting connections
- c) connect() is used by clients, not servers
- d) receive() is not a standard TCP server method

**Key Concept:** Server-side socket API for connection handling

---

### Question 5: Socket API Function Purpose (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** University Test Banks, GeeksforGeeks

**Complete Question:**
Which socket API function converts an active TCP socket into a passive listening socket?
a) `connect()`
b) `bind()`
c) `listen()`
d) `accept()`

**Correct Answer:** c) `listen()`

**Explanation:** listen() converts a socket to passive mode, allowing it to accept incoming connections. It specifies willingness to accept connections and sets the connection queue size.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) connect() initiates active connection to a server
- b) bind() associates socket with local address/port
- d) accept() extracts connection from queue, doesn't create passive socket

**Key Concept:** Socket state transitions in server setup

---

### Question 6: Server Socket Sequence (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** CMU 15-441 Computer Networks Materials

**Complete Question:**
What is the correct sequence of socket API calls for a TCP server?
a) `socket() → connect() → read/write() → close()`
b) `socket() → bind() → listen() → accept() → read/write() → close()`
c) `socket() → listen() → bind() → accept() → read/write() → close()`
d) `socket() → bind() → accept() → listen() → read/write() → close()`

**Correct Answer:** b) `socket() → bind() → listen() → accept() → read/write() → close()`

**Explanation:** Servers must: create socket, bind to address/port, listen for connections, accept clients, communicate, then close.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) This is client sequence (uses connect, not bind/listen/accept)
- c) bind() must come before listen()
- d) listen() must come before accept()

**Key Concept:** Complete server socket programming workflow

## Port Numbers and Addressing

### Question 7: Port Range Selection (Fill-in-the-blank)
**Source:** Multiple University Course Materials

**Complete Question:**
User-defined applications should use port numbers in the range _______ to _______, as ports 0-1024 are reserved for well-known services.

**Correct Answer:** 1025 to 65535

**Explanation:** Ports 0-1024 are reserved for system services (HTTP:80, SMTP:25). Applications should use 1025-65535 to avoid conflicts. Some sources further divide this into registered (1024-49151) and dynamic (49152-65535).

**Key Concept:** Port number allocation and conventions

---

### Question 8: Socket Address Components (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** Testbook, CCNA Materials

**Complete Question:**
What defines a socket address in network communication?
a) IP address and MAC address
b) IP address and port number
c) MAC address and port number
d) Only IP address

**Correct Answer:** b) IP address and port number

**Explanation:** A socket is uniquely identified by IP address (identifies host) plus port number (identifies application/service on that host).

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) MAC addresses operate at data link layer, not transport
- c) MAC addresses aren't part of socket addressing
- d) IP alone can't identify specific application

**Key Concept:** Socket addressing fundamentals

---

### Question 9: Client Requirements (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** Sanfoundry, Kurose & Ross Materials

**Complete Question:**
What information must a TCP client know to connect to a server?
a) Server's IP address only
b) Server's port number only
c) Both server's IP address and port number
d) Client's own IP address and port

**Correct Answer:** c) Both server's IP address and port number

**Explanation:** Clients need both: IP address identifies the server machine, port number identifies the specific service/application on that server.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) IP alone doesn't identify which service
- b) Port alone doesn't identify which machine
- d) Client's address is handled automatically by OS

**Key Concept:** Client-side connection requirements

---

## Connection Management

### Question 10: TCP Handshake Sequence (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** CCNA/Network+ Certification Materials

**Complete Question:**
During TCP connection establishment, what sequence occurs?
a) SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK
b) ACK → SYN → SYN-ACK
c) SYN → ACK → SYN-ACK
d) Connect → Accept → Data

**Correct Answer:** a) SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK

**Explanation:** Three-way handshake: Client sends SYN, server responds with SYN-ACK, client confirms with ACK. This synchronizes sequence numbers and establishes connection.

**Why others are wrong:**
- b) Wrong order - SYN must come first
- c) Wrong order - SYN-ACK comes after SYN
- d) These are API calls, not protocol messages

**Key Concept:** TCP three-way handshake protocol

### Question 11: Multiple Client Handling (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** UNCW CSC344 Midterm Exam

**Complete Question:**
When an HTTP server communicates with 10 web browsers, how many sockets are open on the server?
a) 1
b) 10
c) 11
d) 20

**Correct Answer:** c) 11

**Explanation:** One listening socket (accepts connections) plus 10 connected sockets (one per client). The listening socket remains open to accept new connections.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) Server needs separate socket per client
- b) Forgets the listening socket
- d) Overcounts - only 11 total needed

**Key Concept:** Server socket architecture with multiple clients

---

## Python Socket Programming Specifics

### Question 12: Message Encoding (Fill-in-the-blank)
**Source:** Kurose & Ross Socket Programming Exercises

**Complete Question:**
In Python 3, before sending a string through a socket, you must call the _______ method to convert it to bytes.

**Correct Answer:** encode() or encode

**Explanation:** Python 3 sockets transmit bytes, not strings. Use `message.encode()` to convert string to bytes before sending, and `decode()` to convert received bytes back to string.

**Key Concept:** Python 3 string/bytes conversion for sockets

---

### Question 13: UDP Programming (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** EXAMRADAR, University Materials

**Complete Question:**
Which methods does a UDP socket use for communication in Python?
a) `send()` and `recv()`
b) `sendto()` and `recvfrom()`
c) `connect()` and `accept()`
d) `write()` and `read()`

**Correct Answer:** b) `sendto()` and `recvfrom()`

**Explanation:** UDP uses sendto() to specify destination with each packet, and recvfrom() returns data plus sender's address. These methods handle the connectionless nature of UDP.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) Used for TCP connected sockets
- c) TCP connection establishment methods
- d) File I/O methods, not socket methods

**Key Concept:** UDP-specific socket methods

---

## Application Protocol Selection

### Question 14: Protocol Requirements (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** GeeksforGeeks Transport Layer Quiz

**Complete Question:**
Which transport protocols are used for: real-time multimedia, file transfer, DNS queries, and email?
a) UDP, TCP, UDP, TCP
b) TCP, UDP, TCP, UDP
c) UDP, UDP, TCP, TCP
d) TCP, TCP, UDP, UDP

**Correct Answer:** a) UDP, TCP, UDP, TCP

**Explanation:** 
- Real-time multimedia: UDP (speed over reliability)
- File transfer: TCP (must be reliable)
- DNS: UDP (small queries, speed important)
- Email: TCP (must guarantee delivery)

**Key Concept:** Matching transport protocol to application requirements

---

### Question 15: Server Types (Multiple Choice)
**Source:** Testbook, University Materials

**Complete Question:**
When multiple TCP clients send segments to the same destination port at a server, those segments will be:
a) Directed to the same socket
b) Directed to different sockets
c) Dropped if socket is busy
d) Queued in a single buffer

**Correct Answer:** b) Directed to different sockets

**Explanation:** TCP uses 4-tuple (source IP, source port, dest IP, dest port) for demultiplexing. Each client connection gets its own socket on the server, even when connecting to the same port.

**Why others are wrong:**
- a) Would only be true for UDP
- c) TCP doesn't drop due to busy sockets
- d) Each connection has separate buffers

**Key Concept:** TCP connection demultiplexing and socket isolation
