QUICK GIT PUSH INSTRUCTIONS

1. FIRST - Navigate to your project folder:
   cd /path/to/your/project

2. Check what files have changed:
   git status

3. IF git status shows nothing:
   - Make sure you saved your files
   - Check you're in the right folder (use 'pwd' to see current directory)
   - Check if you're in a git repository (look for .git folder with 'ls -la')

4. Add all changes:
   git add .

5. Commit with message:
   git commit -m "latest"

6. Push to GitHub:
   git push

IF PUSH FAILS:
- First time pushing? Use: git push -u origin main
- Different branch? Use: git push origin your-branch-name
- Authentication error? Check your credentials/token
